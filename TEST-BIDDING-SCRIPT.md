# Bidding Functionality Test Script

This script will help you test the improved bidding functionality across multiple devices.

## Prerequisites
- Backend server running
- Frontend application running
- Two or more devices (or browsers) connected to the application

## Test 1: Basic Bid Synchronization

1. **Setup:**
   - Device 1: Open the auction page for a specific product
   - Device 2: Open the same auction page for the same product
   - Both devices should be logged in with different accounts

2. **Actions:**
   - Device 1: Place a bid (e.g., $50)
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Device 2: Check if the new bid appears in the bid history

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Both devices should show the new bid in the bid history
   - Both devices should update the current highest bid amount
   - Both devices should show a toast notification about the new bid

## Test 2: Page Refresh Test

1. **Setup:**
   - Device 1: Open the auction page and place a bid
   - Device 2: Open the same auction page

2. **Actions:**
   - Device 2: Refresh the page

3. **Expected Result:**
   - After refresh, Device 2 should still see all previous bids
   - The current highest bid should remain accurate

## Test 3: Connection Recovery

1. **Setup:**
   - Device 1: Open the auction page
   - Device 2: Open the same auction page

2. **Actions:**
   - Device 1: Place a bid
   - Device 2: Disconnect from the internet (turn off Wi-Fi or network)
   - Device 1: Place another bid
   - Device 2: Reconnect to the internet
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for reconnection

3. **Expected Result:**
   - After reconnection, Device 2 should show all bids, including those made while disconnected
   - The current bid amount should be correctly synchronized

## Test 4: Rapid Bidding

1. **Setup:**
   - Device 1: Open the auction page
   - Device 2: Open the same auction page

2. **Actions:**
   - Device 1: Place a bid
   - Immediately (within 1-2 seconds) Device 2: Place a higher bid
   - Immediately Device 1: Place an even higher bid

3. **Expected Result:**
   - All bids should appear in the correct order on both devices
   - No duplicate bids should appear
   - The final highest bid should be correctly displayed

## Test 5: State Update Request

1. **Setup:**
   - Device 1: Open the auction page and place several bids
   - Close the auction page on Device 1
   - Device 2: Join the auction page after bids have been placed

2. **Actions:**
   - On Device 2, verify that all previous bids are visible
   - Click the "Refresh" button (if available)

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Device 2 should see all previous bids in the history
   - The refresh should not create duplicates or change the order

## Debugging Tips

If any test fails, check the following:

1. **Browser Console Logs:**
   - Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Look for any error messages or socket-related logs
   - Check that socket connections are being established

2. **Server Logs:**
   - Check the terminal where the backend server is running
   - Look for any errors related to socket connections or database operations

3. **Network Tab:**
   - In the browser's developer tools, check the Network tab
   - Look for WebSocket connections and their status

## Reporting Results

For each test, document:
- Whether it passed or failed
- Any error messages observed
- The time between actions and observed results
- Any inconsistencies between devices
